## Motivation

As a team of passionate gamers and designers, we understand the transformative power of a dedicated game engine. All three of the members in the team enjoy playing game and game design, which is our motivation to create a tool that strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and powerful features, empowering indie developers and small studios to bring their creative visions to life without being overwhelmed by unnecessary complexity.

Rust's strong performance and memory safety make it ideal for building high-efficiency applications like game engines. However, despite the growing ecosystem, the Rust community currently lacks a game engine explicitly tailored for 2D game development. While general-purpose engines like Bevy and Amethyst offer impressive functionality, their dual focus on 2D and 3D game development introduces a layer of complexity and overhead that can feel unnecessary and daunting for developers focused exclusively on 2D games.

Our project is an opportunity to address this gap while immersing ourselves in a deeply satisfying and enjoyable development process. Building a 2D game engine allows us to combine our passion for game design, Rust, and systems programming. The challenge of creating something lightweight yet robust, simple yet feature-rich, sparks our creativity and pushes our technical expertise. Knowing we might be enabling indie creators to focus on their visions without being bogged down by unnecessary complexity also brings us joy.

This engine is designed to be a "dummy-can-use" toolâ€”intuitive enough for beginners to dive into game development while still providing advanced capabilities for experienced developers. By focusing solely on 2D, we eliminate the bloat and confusion that often come with multi-purpose engines, ensuring that every feature and optimization serves the unique needs of 2D game creators.

## Objective

The primary objective of our Rust 2D Game Engine project is to create a lightweight, cross-platform engine that empowers developers to build 2D games with simplicity and efficiency. By focusing on modularity, performance, and an indie developer-friendly approach, the engine aims to provide an accessible and robust foundation for game development.

Our project emphasize:

- Designing a user-friendly engine that lowers the barrier to entry for beginner game developers while supporting advanced use cases for experienced developers.

- Leveraging Rust's strengths in memory safety and high performance to ensure the engine is optimized for a wide range of 2D game projects, from small prototypes to larger, more complex games.

- Providing a flexible, modular architecture that allows developers to pick and integrate only the components they need, ensuring adaptability to different project requirements.

- Ensuring that games built with the engine can run seamlessly across multiple platforms, including desktop, web, and mobile environments.

- Streamlining the game development process by enabling rapid iteration and experimentation through intuitive tools, a Lua scripting system, and visual interfaces.

```

#### Setting up a Basic Scene

```rust
// Initialize engine
let mut render_engine = RenderEngine::new();

// Set up camera
render_engine.camera.move_by(0.0, 0.0);  // Center camera
render_engine.camera.zoom_by(1.0);       // Default zoom

// Load and position a sprite
let sprite_id = render_engine.load_texture(&player_resource)?;
let transform = Transform::new()
    .with_position(100.0, 100.0)
    .with_uniform_scale(1.0);
```

#### Camera System

The camera system provides viewport control with:

- Pan/move functionality
- Zoom control (0.1x to 10.0x)
- World-to-screen coordinate conversion

```rust
// Smooth camera follow
let player_pos = player.get_position();
camera.move_by(
    (player_pos.0 - camera.position.0) * 0.1,  // Smooth X follow
    (player_pos.1 - camera.position.1) * 0.1   // Smooth Y follow
);

// Zoom to fit scene
camera.zoom_by(0.8);  // Zoom out
camera.zoom_by(1.2);  // Zoom in
```

#### Transform System

Handles object positioning and manipulation:

- Position (x, y coordinates)
- Rotation (in radians)
- Scale (width, height multipliers)

```rust
// Create and modify transform
let mut transform = Transform::new()
    .with_position(100.0, 100.0)
    .with_rotation(0.0)
    .with_scale(1.0, 1.0);

// Scale sprite without modifying original image
transform.scale = (0.5, 0.5);  // Half size
transform.scale = (2.0, 2.0);  // Double size

// Rotate sprite
transform.rotation = std::f32::consts::PI * 0.5;  // 90 degrees
```

#### Layer System

Manages rendering order with four predefined layers:

- Background (0)
- Game (1)
- UI (2)
- Debug (3)

```rust
// Create entities in different layers
let background = Entity::new()
    .with_sprite(background_texture)
    .with_layer(RenderLayer::Background);

let player = Entity::new()
    .with_sprite(player_texture)
    .with_layer(RenderLayer::Game);

let health_bar = Entity::new()
    .with_sprite(ui_texture)
    .with_layer(RenderLayer::UI);
```

#### Texture Management

- Supports PNG and JPEG formats
- Maintains original dimensions and aspect ratios
- Efficient texture data storage and retrieval

#### Animation Support

Optional animation system with:

- Frame-based animation
- Playback controls (play/pause/stop)
- Looping options
- Variable playback speed
- Frame selection

```rust
// Create and control animation
let mut player_animation = Animation::new(walk_frames, 1.0/12.0);  // 12 FPS

// Basic controls
player_animation.play();      // Start playing
player_animation.pause();     // Pause at current frame
player_animation.stop();      // Stop and reset to first frame

// Advanced controls
player_animation.set_looping(true);   // Loop animation
player_animation.set_speed(2.0);      // Play at double speed
player_animation.set_frame(3);        // Jump to specific frame
```

### [Entity Component System (ECS)](/src/ecs.rs)

_The Entity Component System (ECS) is the core architecture of our game engine, providing a flexible and efficient way to create and manage game objects. It follows a composition-over-inheritance pattern, making it easy to create complex game objects without deep inheritance hierarchies._

#### System Overview

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class SceneManager {
        +scenes: HashMap<Uuid, Scene>
        +shared_entities: HashMap<Uuid, Entity>
        +active_scene: Option<Uuid>
        +new()

        +delete_scene(id: Uuid)
        +create_shared_entity(name: str)
        +delete_shared_entity(id: Uuid)
        +set_active_scene(id: Uuid)
        +get_active_scene()
    }

    class Scene {
        +id: Uuid
        +name: String
        +entities: HashMap<Uuid, Entity>
        +resources: HashMap<Uuid, Resource>

        +add_shared_entity_ref(id: Uuid)
        +remove_shared_entity_ref(id: Uuid)
    }

    class Entity {
        +id: Uuid
        +name: String
        +attributes: HashMap<Uuid, Attribute>
        +resource_list: Vec<Uuid>
        +new(id: Uuid, name: str)
        +change_entity_name(new_name: str)
        +attach_resource(resource_id: Uuid)
        +detach_resource(resource_id: Uuid)
        +create_attribute(name: str, type: AttributeType, value: AttributeValue)
    }

    class Resource {
        +id: Uuid
        +name: String
        +file_path: String
        +resource_type: ResourceType
        +display()
        +play()
        +pause()
        +stop()
        +edit()
    }

    class Attribute {
        +id: Uuid
        +name: String
        +data_type: AttributeType
        +value: AttributeValue
    }

    class ResourceType {
        <<enumeration>>
        Image
        Sound
        Script
    }

    class AttributeType {
        <<enumeration>>
        Integer
        Float
        String
        Boolean
        Vector2
    }

    SceneManager "1" --> "*" Scene : manages scenes
    SceneManager "1" --> "*" Entity : manages shared entities
    Scene "1" --> "*" Entity : contains local entities
    Scene ..> Entity : references shared entities
    Scene "1" --> "*" Resource : contains
    Entity "1" --> "*" Attribute : has
    Entity "1" --> "*" Resource : references
    Resource --> "1" ResourceType : has type
    Attribute --> "1" AttributeType : has type
```

ECS implementation consists of four main parts:

1. **Scene Manager**

   - Top-level controller managing multiple scenes and shared entities
   - Handles scene creation, deletion, and switching
   - Maintains shared entities accessible across scenes
   - Tracks active scene for easy access
   - Example: Managing different levels, menus, or game states

2. **Scene**

   - Container for entities, resources, and shared entity references
   - Manages the game world state
   - Can reference shared entities from the scene manager
   - Example: A game level containing players, enemies, and items

3. **Entity**

   - Can be either scene-specific or shared across scenes
   - Holds attributes and resource references
   - Can represent anything from players to UI elements
   - Example: A player character with position, health, and sprite

4. **Components**
   - **Attributes**: Data components (position, health, speed)
   - **Resources**: External assets (images, sounds, scripts)

#### Key Features

##### 1. Hierarchical Structure

```
SceneManager
â”œâ”€â”€ Shared Entities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Entity 1 (e.g., "GlobalPlayer")
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Attributes
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Resources
â””â”€â”€ Scenes
    â””â”€â”€ Scene 1 (e.g., "Level1")
        â”œâ”€â”€ Local Entities
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Entity 2 (e.g., "Enemy")
        â”œâ”€â”€ Resources
        â””â”€â”€ Shared Entity References
```

##### 2. Flexible Component System

- **Attributes**: Store entity-specific data

  ```rust
  // Position component
  entity.create_attribute("position", AttributeType::Vector2, Vector2(0.0, 0.0));

  // Health component
  entity.create_attribute("health", AttributeType::Integer, Integer(100));
  ```

##### 3. Resource Management

- **Centralized Resource Handling**: Resources are managed at the scene level
- **Reference System**: Entities reference resources by ID
- **Type Safety**: Resources are typed (Image, Sound, Script)
  ```rust
  // Create and reference a resource
  let texture_id = scene.create_resource("player", "player.png", ResourceType::Image);
  player.attach_resource(texture_id);
  ```

#### Usage

See [Creating a Player Character](#creating-a-player-character-with-ecs), [Creating and Using Shared Entities](#creating-and-using-shared-entities-with-ecs), and [Creating an Interactive Object](#creating-an-interactive-object-with-ecs) in [Users Guide](#users-guide)

#### Best Practices and Tips

1. **Entity Design**

   - Use shared entities for objects that persist across scenes
   - Keep scene-specific entities local to their scenes
   - Use meaningful names for entities and attributes

2. **Resource Management**

   - Share resources between entities when possible
   - Clean up unused resources
   - Use appropriate resource types

3. **Scene Organization**
   - Divide complex games into multiple scenes
   - Use scene transitions for level management
   - Keep scene hierarchies clean and logical

### [Script Interpreter](/src/script_interpreter.rs)

_The Script Interpreter is a crucial component of our 2D game engine, enabling the integration of `lua` scripting capabilities, which is a simple and popular choice in the game industry. It utilizes [rlua](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/rlua), a high-level Lua binding for Rust, to provide a seamless interface between Rust and Lua._

#### Features

- Run Lua scripts within the Rust environment
- Pass data between Rust and Lua
- Execute complex Lua scripts for game logic
- Handle Lua errors gracefully

#### Implementation Details

The core of the script interpreter is the [`run_lua_script`](/src/script_interpreter.rs#L4) function in [`script_interpreter.rs`](/src/script_interpreter.rs), which initializes a new Lua context and executes the provided Lua script.

#### Unit Tests

The test suite in [`script_interpreter_test.rs`](tests/script_interpreter_test.rs) verifies various aspects of the Lua integration:

1. **Simple Script Execution** - `test_run_simple_script` :

   - Runs a basic Lua script that performs addition, ensuring basic Lua scripts can be executed without errors.

2. **Error Handling** - `test_run_script_with_error`:

   - Verifies that Lua handles undefined variables correctly by treating them as `nil`.

3. **Math Operations** - `test_lua_math_operations`:

   - Verifies complex mathematical operations can be performed accurately in Lua.

4. **Data Passing (Rust to Lua)** - `test_pass_data_to_lua`:

   - Demonstrates passing data from Rust to Lua.

5. **Data Returning (Lua to Rust)** - `test_return_data_from_lua`:

   - Shows how to call Lua functions from Rust and retrieve results.

6. **Complex Script Execution** - `test_complex_script`:

   - Tests a more complex script involving object manipulation and function definitions.

7. **Error Handling in Lua** - `test_handle_error_in_lua_script`:

   - Verifies Lua's behavior with potential runtime errors, such as division by zero.

#### Usage

See [Script Interpreter for Game Logic](#script-interpreter-for-game-logic) in [Users Guide](#users-guide).

### [Audio Engine](/src/audio_engine.rs)

_The Audio Engine is a crucial component of our 2D game engine, responsible for handling sound playback. It utilizes [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio), a pure Rust audio playback library, to manage audio streams and control sound output._

#### Features

- Simple audio playback from file
- Pause and resume functionality
- Ability to check if audio is currently playing

#### Implementation Details

The `AudioEngine` struct is the core of our audio system. It contains:

- An `OutputStream` for audio output
- An `OutputStreamHandle` for creating new sounds
- A `Sink` for controlling audio playback

Key methods include:

- `new()`: Initializes the audio engine with default output stream and sink.
- `play_sound(file_path: &str)`: Loads and plays an audio file from the given path.
- `is_playing()`: Checks if audio is currently playing.
- `pause()`: Pauses the current audio playback.
- `resume()`: Resumes paused audio playback.

The engine uses `BufReader` and `Decoder` from the `rodio` crate to efficiently read and decode audio files.

#### Error Handling

The `play_sound` method returns a `Result`, allowing for graceful error handling if the file is not found or cannot be decoded.

#### Unit Tests

The unit tests ([`audio_engine_test.rs`](tests/audio_engine_test.rs)) thoroughly verify the functionality of the `AudioEngine`:

1. **Initialization Test**:

   - Ensures the audio engine initializes correctly with an empty sink.

2. **Play Sound Test**:

   - Verifies that a sound file can be successfully loaded and played.
   - Checks that the engine correctly reports when audio is playing.
   - Confirms that the audio stops playing when explicitly stopped.

3. **Is Playing Test**:
   - Checks the initial state (not playing).
   - Verifies correct state after playing a sound.
   - Tests pause functionality and ensures the engine reports correct state.
   - Checks resume functionality.
   - Verifies correct state after stopping the audio.

These tests use a constant `TEST_AUDIO_FILE` path, which should point to a valid audio file in the test environment.

#### Usage

See [Game Audio](#game-audio) in [Users Guide](#users-guide).

### [Input Handling](/src/input_handler.rs)

_A responsive, platform-agnostic input management system that ensures smooth and intuitive player interactions._

- Built with the [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) crate to provide device support, handling inputs from keyboards, mice, touchscreens, and game controllers.

- Implements advanced input mapping and processing with low latency, supporting complex input combinations and gestures.

- Offers configurable input schemes and easy integration with the ECS for flexible control mechanisms.

### [Project Manager](/src/project_manager.rs)

_The Project Manager handles game project creation, loading, saving, building, and asset importing. It provides a structured way to manage game projects and their assets._

#### Project Structure

```
game_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/    # PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF

## User's Guide

### In Rust

#### Integrate our Rendering Engine in your game:

```rust
use rust_2d_game_engine::render_engine::{RenderEngine, Sprite};

// Create renderer
let mut renderer = RenderEngine::new();

// Create sprites
let sprites = vec![
    Sprite {
        position: (100.0, 100.0),
        size: (50.0, 50.0),
        rotation: 0.0,
        texture_coords: (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0),
    },
    // Add more sprites as needed
];

// In the game loop
renderer.render_frame(&sprites).expect("Failed to render frame");
```

#### Physics Engine Usage

To use the Physics Engine:

1. Create an instance of `PhysicsEngine` using `PhysicsEngine::new()`.
2. Add rigid bodies to the simulation with `add_rigid_body()`.
3. Call `step()` in your game loop to advance the physics simulation.
4. Use `handle_collisions()` to detect and respond to collisions.

Example:

```rust
use rust_2d_game_engine::physics_engine::PhysicsEngine;

let mut physics_engine = PhysicsEngine::new();

// Add a dynamic body
physics_engine.add_rigid_body([0.0, 5.0], true);

// In the game loop
physics_engine.step();
physics_engine.handle_collisions();
```

#### Creating and Using Shared Entities with ECS

```rust
// Create a shared entity in the scene manager
let player_id = scene_manager.create_shared_entity("Player");

// Reference the shared entity in a scene
scene.add_shared_entity_ref(player_id);

// Access the shared entity through the scene
if let Some(player) = scene.get_shared_entity_ref(scene_manager, player_id) {
    // Use the shared entity
}
```

#### Creating a Player Character with ECS

```rust
// Create entity
let player_id = scene.create_entity("Player");
let player = scene.get_entity_mut(player_id).unwrap();

// Add components
player.create_attribute("position", Vector2(0.0, 0.0));
player.create_attribute("health", Integer(100));
player.create_attribute("speed", Float(5.0));

// Add resources
let sprite_id = scene.create_resource("player_sprite", "player.png", ResourceType::Image);
player.attach_resource(sprite_id);
```

#### Creating an Interactive Object with ECS

```rust
// Create a collectible item
let coin_id = scene.create_entity("Coin");
let coin = scene.get_entity_mut(coin_id).unwrap();

// Add components
coin.create_attribute("position", Vector2(100.0, 100.0));
coin.create_attribute("is_collected", Boolean(false));
coin.create_attribute("value", Integer(10));

// Add resources
let coin_sprite = scene.create_resource("coin_sprite", "coin.png", ResourceType::Image);
let collect_sound = scene.create_resource("collect_sound", "collect.wav", ResourceType::Sound);
coin.attach_resource(coin_sprite);
coin.attach_resource(collect_sound);
```

#### Script Interpreter for Game Logic

To use the Script Interpreter for game logic:

- Use `run_lua_script(script)` to execute Lua code.
- For more complex interactions, use the `rlua::Lua` context directly to set globals, call functions, or retrieve values.

Example:

```rust
use rust_2d_game_engine::script_interpreter;

let script = r#"
    function greet(name)
        return "Hello, " .. name .. "!"
    end
"#;

script_interpreter::run_lua_script(script).expect("Failed to run script");
```

Further interaction with the script can be done using `rlua` directly.

#### Game Audio

To use the `AudioEngine` for game audio:

1. Create an instance of `AudioEngine` using `AudioEngine::new()`.
2. Use `play_sound(file_path)` to play audio files.
3. Control playback with `pause()` and `resume()`.
4. Check playback status with `is_playing()`.

#### Project Manager Usage

##### Project Creation and Management

```rust
// Create a new game project
let project_path = Path::new("path/to/my_game");
ProjectManager::create_project(project_path)?;

// Load project with scene hierarchy
let (metadata, scene_manager) = ProjectManager::load_project_full(project_path)?;

// Save project with scene hierarchy
ProjectManager::save_project_full(project_path, &metadata, &scene_manager)?;
```

##### Asset Import

```rust
// Import an image
let image_path = Path::new("path/to/sprite.png");
let relative_path = ProjectManager::import_asset(
    project_path,
    image_path,
    AssetType::Image
)?;

// Import a sound
let sound_path = Path::new("path/to/effect.wav");
let relative_path = ProjectManager::import_asset(
    project_path,
    sound_path,
    AssetType::Sound
)?;
```

##### Scene Management

```rust
// Load scene hierarchy
let scene_manager = ProjectManager::load_scene_hierarchy(project_path)?;

// Make changes to scenes...

// Save scene hierarchy
ProjectManager::save_scene_hierarchy(project_path, &scene_manager)?;
```

##### Build System

```rust
// Build the project
ProjectManager::build_project(project_path)?;
```
